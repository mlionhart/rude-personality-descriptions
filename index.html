    <h1>ENTJ</h1>
    <p>Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging</p>
    <p>ENTJs value efficiency above all other things. You may even feel rushed in their presence, for no apparent reason
      whatsoever - even if there is no work to be done. ENTJs hate to be corrected; if you do so, prepare to be punched
      in the mouth. Yes, they hate your messy car, house, and anything that resembles a state of apparent chaos. You'll
      possibly be punched for this as well. Feel like crying? Don't. Seriously, it's not a good idea. You will be
      scolded
      for being so manipulative. To ENTJs, unless there's a death in the family, emotions are interpreted as a
      form of manipulation, and will either be
      ignored or out-right condemned. Get in line, shut up, and get er done!</p>

  <div id="ENTP" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ENTP</h1>
    <p>Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving</p>
    <p>
      ENTPs are the type most likely to exhibit signs of hallucinogenic intoxication, even when they are stone sober.
      Their minds are so overactive and imaginative that they appear to be on drugs. They are so unrealistic with Their
      intuitive perceptions that they often can't even tell if a speeding car would hurt them or not. "But, in my
      imagination
      the car sped right through me, as if I were a ghost!" they say. ENTPs are mean, unless they have something they
      want
      from you - like attention, candy, fast food, money, and so on. The only way they know how to communicate is
      through
      manipulation. Welcome to the ENTP personality.</p>

  <div id="INTJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>INTJ</h1>
    <p>Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging</p>
    <p>
      INTJs take independence to a whole new level. In fact, I think the first person to ever legally marry their
      computer was an INTJ. Indeed, they abhor the "common folk" and have no problem telling people they don't
      have time for them (unless you're interesting to them - good luck with that). Feelings? No comprende, senor.
      Don't ever ask an INTJ how they "feel" about an issue; you will save yourself the embarassment, and the tense,
      long and awkward stare into your soul.
      A stare that dismantles every shred of self-esteem you have left as a human being; all because you felt it
      necessary to ask about an INTJs "feelings." INTJs are a paradox, because they genuinely don't care what you
      think (about anything), but they DO care a great deal about their appearance - often taking hours to get
      groomed and ready just to go to the supermarket. Like ENTJs, INTJs have no souls, but at least they keep mostly
      to themselves, so they don't usually do too much damage in the world.</p>

  <div id="INTP" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>INTP</h1>
    <p>Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving</p>
    <p>
      INTPs are the best, most caring, most intelligent, personality type there is.</p>
      <p><img src="images/intp-manhattan.avif" alt="Doctor Manhattan" width="700"></p>
  </div>

  <div id="ENFJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ENFJ</h1>
    <p>Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging</p>
    <p>
      ENFJs are natural leaders, if by leading you mean manipulating and guilt-tripping people into doing their bidding.
      ENFJs are often very successful, due to an uncanny, almost supernatural ability to read souls, mind-screwing
      people into doing
      all of their hard work for them. This, and only this, is how they succeed. The ENFJ is the most affectionate and
      loving personality
      type; the problem is they don't actually care about you, they simply enjoy the stimulation it gives them to
      communicate
      their feelings with hundreds of people per day. You're simply <i>one</i> out of the hundred. If the ENFJ is left
      alone to fend for themself for more than a few minutes,
      they will have a panic attack and immediately call four to seven of their friends to vent their predicament with.
      If you go more than a week without
      communicating with them, they will fear something terrible has happened to you, and will quickly call you to
      "check in." If you don't
      agree with their view of the world, they will think you are a bad person, and will secretly write you off as a human being while
      still treating
      you with the exact same level of friendliness and affection as before. </p>

  <div id="ENFP" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ENFP</h1>
    <p>Extraverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving</p>
    <p>
      Like ENTPs, ENFPs appear to be on drugs at all times, except they crave slightly more attention and praise.
      If you are not looking at an ENFP, they will do something outrageous to get your eyes
      back on them. They are very opinionated people, and they expect you to hang on to every word they say, because
      they just "know" they're right, even if they don't know anything about the subject they are talking about.
      They are the type that sits in on one economics lecture, leaves after 15 minutes due to boredom, and then advises
      a Fortune 500 CEO on how to run their business based on what they "learned." ENFPs are the biggest dumbasses on
      the planet.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="INFJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>INFJ</h1>
    <p>Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging</p>
    <p>
      INFJs are special unicorns. Just ask them, they will tell you. Think you're a good person? The INFJ <i>knows</i>
      you
      are not. INFJs instinctively know that they are morally superior to everyone, and they will even advise the wisest
      sage
      on the "right" ways. INFJs like to play the parent role - to everyone - their friends, siblings, and even their
      own parents.
      Again, they always "know" what's right. Ever see a pissed off INFJ? You won't see them - that's the point. Feel
      like giving
      an INFJ advice like you would a normal person? Don't even <i>think</i> about it. Would you also throw yourself
      into a bonfire
      just for the fun of it? I didn't think so. If you <i>ever</i> even <i>think</i> about giving an INFJ constructive
      advice
      (a phrase INFJs view as an oxymoron), you will regret it after the worst outburst you've ever seen
      from a grown
      adult. But don't worry, you will awake from a phone call at 2am later that night, from a guilty-sounding INFJ, who
      couldn't
      sleep until they apologized to you. </p>

  <div id="INFP" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>INFP</h1>
    <p>Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Perceiving</p>
    <p>
      INFPs, like the ISFPs, are emo, but not quite as much. Their intuition seems to distract them from their "bleeding
      heart"
      affliction to a degree - often providing rich, imaginative dreams involving fairies, elves, and magical places.
      Feelings are all important to INFPs, even though they have no idea how they feel about anything.
      But when the feelings come out un-filtered, like when provoked to anger, make sure you have adequate bullet-proof
      shielding to protect you.
      No, seriously. INFPs take their responsibilities so seriously that they sometimes won't do them at all due to the
      stress. INFPs can't say no.
      Seriously, even try to get them to mouth the word, "no" - they simply can't do it. It's simply a condition of
      being an INFP. When you are
      in a bad mood or angry, the INFP will find a place to hide, hoping that their hiding from you will make you all
      better. INFPs are special snowflakes. </p>

  <div id="ESTJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ESTJ</h1>
    <p>Extraverted Sensing Thinking Judging</p>
    <p>
      ESTJs are the most common personality type, with ESFJs being a close second. ESTJs are
      bossy assholes, with a penchant for angry outbursts caused by nothing more than a harmless
      question. They can go to hell.</p>
      <p><img src="images/estj-oreilly.webp" alt="Bill O'reilly" width="700"></p>
  </div>

  <div id="ESFJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ESFJ</h1>
    <p>Extraverted Sensing Feeling Judging</p>
    <p>
      ESFJs are the second most common personality type, right behind ESTJ's, but they are even more brainless and
      stupid - not to mention crazy. Not sure how to spot an ESFJ? Picture the most fake, vain, cliquey, ditzy,
      screwed up person you can possibly imagine. Got a picture in your head? Well, that's more or less an
      ESFJ. Sounds great, right? On to the next Type:</p>
      <p><img src="images/esfj.jpg" alt="Flight Attendant" width="600"></p>
  </div>

  <div id="ISTJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ISTJ</h1>
    <p>Introverted Sensing Thinking Judging</p>
    <p>
      Try to think of the biggest stick-in-the-mud you know. How annoyingly rule-oriented they are,
      and bitingly critical of everything unfamiliar, or unlike <i>them</i>. In fact, oftentimes their "rule"
      is the more different you are from them, the more disgusting you are to them. But not just
      disgusting, you're just not right - and you're probably also a bad person. Got a problem and need some
      advice or reassurance? Don't even think about coming to the ISTJ, unless it has to
      do with their expertise or their career field. Otherwise, you'll have a disturbed and annoyed ISTJ
      staring back at you, with a look of hatred on their face. Yes, they hate you at that very moment,
      but it'll soon pass, as they get distracted by something else in their immediate environment. To ISTJs,
      all that matters is appearances and material possessions. If you transform your lawn one summer, and
      it ends up looking better than their lawn, this will consume their thoughts until their lawn looks
      better than yours again, if they haven't already died of a heart attack from the whole ordeal. Another
      thing - if you ever decide to be your own boss, and start your own business, to eventually become a
      successful entrepreneur, don't mention this to an ISTJ. They will either shrug off your idea as some sort
      of "child's play kool-aid sale," or they will tell you all of the ways in which you will fail before
      you even start. Don't have your business budget planned out for the year 2053? Then you are an irresponsible loser.
      Moreover, the ISTJ (as well as the ISFJ) sees all entrepreneurs as "unemployed." They
      don't respect people who are self-made and work for themselves. They only respect people who
      work for <i>other </i>people, because accomplishing anything by yourself instead of as part of a team is
      wrong.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="ISFJ" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ISFJ</h1>
    <p>Introverted Sensing Feeling Judging</p>
    <p>
      Have you ever met someone who is so disgustingly ass-kissing toward authority that it just makes you want to
      puke? Well, this is the lucky day you get introduced to the ISFJ personality type! This type will do everything
      is their power to please authority, and refuse to take any credit for anything they do, resulting in a feeling
      or bitterness toward life caused by being such push-overs, but they will eventually blame life for all
      their failures. They enjoy filling this empty void with material objects, hoping they can find happiness through
      material possession. This, of course, only leads to further emptiness. Indeed, ISFJs are screwed in every sense
      of the word.</p>
      <p><img src="images/isfj.jpg" alt="ISFJ" width="350"></p>
  </div>

  <div id="ESTP" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ESTP</h1>
    <p>Extraverted Sensing Thinking Perceiving</p>
    <p>
      ESTPs relish fun and adventure. So much so that it negatively impacts every single person in their lives, not
      just themselves. If there was ever a type that fit the medical definition of a sociopath the most, it would
      be the ESTP. They will stop at nothing to live their lives how THEY want; everyone else can go screw themselves.
      If you ever dare to call out the ESTP on their selfish, destructive behavior, they will try to make you feel like
      a terrible
      person for "being such a dick." Some ESTPs can be funny and entertaining, but that is literally all they are good
      for.
      Other than that, don't trust them within a 1000-mile radius.</p>
      <p><img src="images/estp.webp" alt="ESTP" width="500"></p>
  </div>

  <div id="ESFP" class="tabcontent">
    <h1>ESFP</h1>
    <p>Extraverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving</p>
    <p>
      ESFPs are always ready for a party, preferably while drunk or stoned. If you don't like to get drunk or stoned,
      followed by more drinking and "stoning," they will no longer like you, and assume that something is wrong with
      you. To ESFPs, rational thinking is an oxymoron. Trying to get them to think rationally is like waking a dead
      rat with rat poison - it's not only pointless, it's incredibly stupid (what's wrong with you?). Anyway, fuck
      ESFPs.</p>
